> These install exactly the same as the *Deluxe* mods, as usual make sure you back up each game's `default.xex`
>
> *Due to technical reasons, TBRB on PS3 requires a separate "Disc Patch", extract that and overwrite the files where your base game is installed
>
> **For GDRB on PS3, extract and overwrite the files where your base game is installed
